# Company Valuation Prediction
Predicting startup post-money valuations using venture funding data with 30,000+ records, 60+ features, and high missingness.
This project leverages XGBoost, Random Forest, and Lasso regression to extract insights and provide predictive modeling for investment decision-making.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Venture funding data is often messy, high-dimensional, and incomplete, making valuation prediction a challenging problem.This project builds a data preprocessing and modeling pipeline to clean, encode, and analyze deal and company attributes, and train models to predict PostValuation.

The goal is to:
- Explore the relationship between funding rounds, ownership structures, and valuations
- Handle missingness with domain-informed imputation strategies
- Compare tree-based and linear models for predictive accuracy and interpretability
- Provide actionable insights for stakeholders such as investors and analysts
